  <title>Publication 03</title>
  <body>
    <p>This is publication 03. It's map is organized into submaps, one per chapter. It has a "go up": The chapter-01 map uses a topic from the common/ directory that is a sibling to the publication's directory, rather than being beneath it.</p>
    <p>The difference between publication 03 and publication 02 is that the publication 03 root map is above all the publication-specific and common directories.</p>
