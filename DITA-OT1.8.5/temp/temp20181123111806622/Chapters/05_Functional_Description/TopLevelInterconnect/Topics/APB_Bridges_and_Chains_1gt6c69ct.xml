Many blocks and subsystems in the device do not require reconfiguration during such events and so can be excluded from performance evaluation when developing the interconnect. This set of low-performance requiring devices includes all SERDES blocks. There is also limited need for reconfiguration of some digital subsystems. To reduce wiring complexity, APB bridges and several daisy-chained APB buses are implemented for these devices, as shown in the block diagram. The daisy-chain operation significantly reduces configuration performance, because each stage of the chain generally incurs one or two clock cycles of latency in APB PSEL and READY propagation. In cases where digital subsystem are present on the chain, they are placed near the beginning of the chain, on the premise that their reconfiguration is somewhat more common (but still rare) than SERDES reconfiguration (virtually non-existent).</p>

It is recommended that subsystems be placed at or near the beginning of their respective chains.</p>
