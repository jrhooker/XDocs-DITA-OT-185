  <title>Microchip Devices Code Protection Feature</title>

  <body>
    <p>Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip
    devices:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Microchip products meet the specification contained in their
      particular Microchip Data Sheet.</p></li>

      <li><p>Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most
      secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.</p></li>

      <li><p>There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach
      the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our knowledge,
      require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating
      specifications contained in Microchipâ€™s Data Sheets. Most likely, the
      person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.</p></li>

      <li><p>Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned
      about the integrity of their code. </p></li>

      <li><p>Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can
      guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not mean that
      we are guaranteeing the product as "unbreakable." </p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed
    to continuously improving the code protection features of our products.
    Attempts to break Microchip's code protection feature may be a violation
    of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts allow unauthorized
    access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to
    sue for relief under that Act.</p>
